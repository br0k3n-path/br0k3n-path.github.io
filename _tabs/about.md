**This is something about me!**

I'm a security engineer, I'm not confident about this role cause I have no degrees or certificates to prove that I can do something or am good at something. But I'll try my best to reach out.

I experienced with ... I don't know, I can do a lot, but ... you know when someone knows too many things, so nothing he knows it well.

That's all if you want to know more. Let's have a meeting!

**Cheer!**
